## Motivation

There are a _lot_ of web analytics tools. Unfortunately, most of them come with the following caveats:

* They require handing all of your visitors' info to a third-party company
* They use cookies to track visitors across sessions, so you need to have those annoying cookie notices
* They collect so much personal data that even the NSA is jealous
* They are closed source and/or expensive, often with limited data portability
* They are hard to use

Shynet has **none** of these caveats. You host it yourself, so the data is _yours_. It works without cookies, so you don't need any intrusive cookie notices. It collects just enough data to be useful, but not enough to be creepy. It's open source and _intended_ to be self-hosted. And you may even find the interface easy to use.

> **Shynet** is a portmanteau of "Skynet" and "shy." The idea is that it gives you loads of useful information (Skynet) while also respecting your visitors' privacy (shy).

## Screenshots

_Note: These screenshots have been edited to hide sensitive data. The "real" Shynet has a lot more pages and information available, but hopefully this gives you an idea of the general look and feel of the tool._

> **Shynet is built using [a17t](https://github.com/milesmcc/a17t),** an atomic design library. Customization and extension is simple; [learn more about a17t](https://github.com/milesmcc/a17t).

## Features

#### Architecture

* **Runs on a single machine** &mdash; Because it's so small, Shynet can easily run as a single docker container on a single small VPS
* **...or across a giant Kubernetes cluster** &mdash; For higher traffic installations, Shynet can be deployed with as many parallelized ingress nodes as needed, with Redis caching and separate backend workers for database IO
* **Built using Django** &mdash; Shynet is built using Django, so deploying, updating, and migrating can be done without headaches
* **Multiple users and sites** &mdash; A single Shynet instance can support multiple users, each tracking multiple different sites

#### Tracking

* **JavaScript not required** &mdash; It will fallback to using a 1x1 transparent tracking pixel if JavaScript isn't available
* **Lightweight** &mdash; The [tracking script](/shynet/analytics/templates/analytics/scripts/page.js) weighs less than a kilobyte (and doesn't look like your typical tracking script)
* **Generally not blocked** &mdash; Because you host Shynet yourself, it tends not to be on ad block lists
* **Primary-key integration** &mdash; You can easily associate visitors in Shynet with their user accounts on your site (if that's something you want)

#### Metrics

Here's the information Shynet can give you about your visitors:

* **Hits** &mdash; how many pages on your site were opened/viewed
* **Sessions** &mdash; how many times your site was visited (essentially a collection of hits)
* **Page load time** &mdash; how long the pages on your site look to load
* **Bounce rate** &mdash; the percentage of visitors who left after just one page
* **Duration** &mdash; how long visitors stayed on the site
* **Referrers** &mdash; the links visitors followed to get to your site
* **Locations** &mdash; the relative popularity of all the pages on your site
* **Operating system** &mdash; your visitors' OS (from user agent)
* **Browser** &mdash; your visitors' browser (from user agent)
* **Geographic location & network** &mdash; general location of your visitors (from IP)
* **Device type** &mdash; whether your visitors are using a desktop, tablet, or phone (from user agent)

#### Workflow
* **Collaboration built-in** &mdash; Administrators can easily share services with other users, as well
* **Accounts (or not)** &mdash; Shynet has a fully featured account management workflow (powered by [Django Allauth](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/))

## Recommendations

Shynet isn't for everyone. It's great for personal projects and small to medium size websites, but hasn't been tested with ultra-high traffic sites. It also requires a fair amount of technical know-how to deploy and maintain, so if you need a one-click solution, you're best served with other tools. 

## Concepts

Shynet is pretty simple, but there are a few key terms you need to know in order to use it effectively:

**Services** are the properties on the web you'd like to track. These generally correspond to websites or single top-level domains. Shynet generates one tracking embed per service.

**Hits** are a single page-load on one of your services.

**Sessions** are a collection of hits (or just one) that are made by the same browser in a short period of time.

## Installation

You can find instructions on getting started and usage in the [Usage Guide](GUIDE.md#installation). Out of the box, we support deploying via a simple Docker container, docker-compose, Heroku, or Kubernetes (see [kubernetes](/kubernetes)).

## FAQ

**Does Shynet respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals?** Yes. While there isn't any standardized way to handle DNT requests, Shynet allows you to specify whether you want to collect any data from users with DNT enabled on a per-service basis. (By default, Shynet will _not_ collect any data from users who specify DNT.)

**Is this GDPR compliant?** It depends on how you use it. If you're worried about GDPR, you should talk to a lawyer about your particular data collection practices. I'm not a lawyer. (And this isn't legal advice.)
